## 📖 Overview

This repository contains the full Markdown draft of the Medium article:

> **Engineering Reliability Into Software: Lessons from the Field and the Backend**

The article explores how the design philosophies used in civil and municipal engineering — redundancy, safety factors, documentation, testing, and long-term maintenance — directly translate to backend development. Using **CostQueryPro** as a real-world example, it highlights how reliability is engineered, not improvised.

## 🧩 Article Structure

| Section | Summary |
|----------|----------|
| **1. Introduction** | Introduces the engineering mindset and parallels between physical and digital systems. |
| **2. Redundancy and Safety Factors** | Connects physical redundancy (dual pumps, power backups) to backend reliability (caching, replicas). |
| **3. Predictability Through Standards** | Shows how civil specs and backend coding standards both create predictability and maintainability. |
| **4. Testing and Commissioning** | Links startup inspections and hydrostatic tests to CI/CD, unit testing, and code validation. |
| **5. Operation and Maintenance** | Draws parallels between SCADA monitoring and software observability/logging. |
| **6. Closing Thoughts** | Reflects on reliability as a universal engineering mindset. |
| **7. Stay Connected** | Provides links for professional connection and follow-up. |
